# SelfDrivingCar
This is a simulation of how AI would learn to drive a car.
In this simulation you have to save the best car intelligence by pressing the 'Save' button.
Discard the saved best car intelligence by pressing 'Delete' button.
You may need to save multiple times as the car would learn better the more time the simulation runs.
Or you can click the 'Solution' button to get the best AI intelligence and won't have to run the tests.
On your right is the neural network visualization and on the left is the simulation.
You can select the number of AI cars to run in a test by choosing No.of cars.
You can also choose the amount of mutation you need ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 . 
In simple words less the value of mutation, less will be the difference between parent and child generation.
More the value of mutation, more will be the deviation from parent generation.
If you don't want to save a particular test simply click 'Refresh' button.
